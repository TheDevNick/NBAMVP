# Name 
NBA MVP


## Description
Since I like sports I decided to create a simple NBA MVP picker. This displays the use of constant variables, click event listeners, functions, 
DOM manipulation, and classList properties.If you don't pick Kevin Durant I might judge you but it's ok!

## Tech Used 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
